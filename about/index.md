<br>
After graduating from **Truman State University** in 2017 with a B.S in Psychology and Cognitive Science, I went to work as a Lab Manager for the <span style="color:blue">[Language Acquisition and Brain Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/q-lab/people/)</span> at the University of Delaware for a year. Here, under the supervision of Zhenghan Qi, we employed a variety of methods from behavioral to neuroimaging techniques to study statistical learning. 
    
In 2018 I joined the Cognitive Science department at **Johns Hopkins University** as a PhD student, working with Geraldine Legendre on the topic of language acquisition. My hope is to be able to create a computational model of language acquisition, specifically in syntactic acquisition, during my time here. Besides that, I am also greatly interested in bilingualisms and psycholinguistics. 
    
When not doing research I enjoy reading, writing, and playing music. I have a blog that I write (in Vietnamese) about <span style="color:blue">[language-related matters](https://wordinthesea.wordpress.com/)</span> (mostly in the realm of language and thought - I discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in multiple posts here). My boyfriend and I also have a <span style="color:blue">[soundcloud channel](https://soundcloud.com/fishpig2511)</span> where we upload piano and guitar covers of the songs we like.
