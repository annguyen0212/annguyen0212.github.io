    After graduating from **Truman State University** in 2017 with a B.S in Psychology and Cognitive Science, I went to work as a Lab Manager for the [Language Acquisition and Brain Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/q-lab/people/) at the University of Delaware for a year. Here, under the supervision of Zhenghan Qi, we employed a variety of methods from behavioral to neuroimaging techniques to study statistical learning. 
    
    In 2018 I joined the Cognitive Science department at Johns Hopkins University as a PhD student, working with Geraldine Legendre on the topic of language acquisition. My hope is to be able to create a computational model of language acquisition, specifically in syntactic acquisition, during my time here. Besides that, I am also greatly interested in bilingualisms and psycholinguistics. 
    
    When not doing research I enjoy reading, writing, and playing music. I have a blog about [language-related matters](https://wordinthesea.wordpress.com/) (mostly in the realm of language and thought - I discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in multiple posts here) written in Vietnamese.
