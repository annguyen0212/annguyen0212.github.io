**December 2021**: I'm going to give an invited talk at the University of Maryland on my recent work in language acquisition!

**November 2021**: I presented a poster on the computational model of the acquisition of multiple variants. This is the work in collaboration with Colin Wilson. I also received the Diversity Travel Fellowship, yay.

**September 2021**: My paper, *The acquisition of wh-questions: Beyond structural economy and input frequency* is finally published on *Language Acquisition*.

**June 2021**: I was informed that my SLI fellowship is renewed for another year! 

**May 2021**: The *Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition North America* 6th conference was moved to an online format because of Covid-19, which means I (sadly) missed my chance to visit Iceland. I gave my virtual talk on my experiment on English-speaking childrenâ€™s acquisition of wh-in-situ.

**February 2021**: Presenting a poster at the Society for Computation in Linguistics 2021, virtually again, of course. 

**November 2020**: I gave a virtual Brown Bag talk on my first-year project titled *The acquisition of English wh-in-situ* to the department of Cognitive Science at JHU.

**October 2020**: I gave a virtual talk titled *Testing syntactic simplicity: wh-in-situ vs. fronted wh-questions in L1
acquisition* at the Many Paths to Language workshop, hosted by the Max Planck Institute Conference.

**September 2020**: After about 4 years of work, the paper I co-authored, *Shaky Scaffolding: Age Differences In Cerebellar Activation Revealed Through Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysi*, is now published on Human Brain Mapping. I got involved in this project as an APA Summer Undergraduate Research Scholar at Texas A&M University in summer 2016.

**April 2020**: I'm honored to receive the **Science of Learning Fellowship** from the Science of Learning Institute. This fellowship rewards graduate students for their multidisciplinary approaches to learning and cognition.

**January 2020**: Presented my poster at LSA 2020. The full paper is published in their proceedings, which you can find it here: <a href="http://www.journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/PLSA/article/viewFile/4696/4323" style="color:blue; text-decoration:none">Covert movement in English probing wh-questions.</a>. 

**November 2019**: Successfully defended my master thesis.
