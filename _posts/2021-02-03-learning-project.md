Does simpler linguistic structure guarantee faster learning? Many theories predict so. Are more frequent elements easier to learn? That sounds like a reasonable hypothesis. But when we have a *low-frequency but simple structure* and a *high-frequency but complex* one, what should we expect? In this project, I investigate factors that influence children’s language acquisition and how they interact with one another.

The first part of the project is an experimental study. I ran an experiment with 14 adults and 27 children to test their comprehension and production of English in-situ information-seeking wh-question (the low-frequency but simple structure) and fronted information-seeking wh-question (the high-frequency but complex). I also conduct a cross-linguistic study to compare the results I have with studies conducted in French. In general, the notable findings include:

-	Children can use prosody to differentiate between the two types of wh-questions
-	Children have both constructions available to them in their grammar space, but they prefer to use the higher-frequency one, despite its complexity.
-	Besides simplicity and frequency, consistency is also an important factor.

Snapshot of the stimuli of my experiment. Because this study was done with children, I had to make sure the content is interesting and fun to keep my participants engaged. I ended up writing whole story (with lots of illustrations). The experiment was embedded into the story, and children would 'unlock' prizes as they went." cols=1 %}



The second part of the project is a computational simulation study. I build a non-parametric Bayesian model that learns about different types of wh-questions. This study is still on-going.
