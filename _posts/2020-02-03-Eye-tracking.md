Do people wait until they finish hearing a sentence to process the information or they do so incrementally? An eye-tracking study can provide great insight into this. This was the work I did when I was a lab manager at the University of Delaware.

I was in charge of the technical side of this study -- programming the experiment so that we could synchronize mouse clicks from the behavioral task, eye-tracking data, and brain wave (EEG) data altogether. The data analysis is still on-going, so there is not much for me to say in terms of findings. But my biggest achievement in this project wasn't about the research result, it was that I (coming from a Psychology background) managed to learn and program this super complicated experiment with lots of data syncrhonization in MATLAB (never used it before this!).
